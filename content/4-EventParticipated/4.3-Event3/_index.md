### Key Content Highlights

#### 1. AWS Foundation and Agentic AI

- **Opening**: Nguyen Gia Hung opens the event, emphasizing the increasingly critical role of **Agentic AI** in today's cloud technology landscape
- **Bedrock Agent Core**: Kien Nguyen provides the difficulty of deploying AI agent from developing phase to production phase and how with the help
of AWS Bedrock Agent Core, this issue could be solved

#### 2. Real-World Applications

- **Building Agentic Workflows**: Viet Pham demonstrates how Diaflow, a data processing platform run on AWS Bedrock Agent Core has leveraged the ability
of Agent Core to simplify the process of building AI agent and make it a service available to both personal user and businesses
- **CloudThinker Introduction**: Thang Ton introduces CloudThinker ecosystem, the end-to-end platform helps user manaage their cloud resources from cost 
managing to monitoring usage of different AWS Services

#### 3. Deep Dive (Level 300)

- **Agent Orchestration & Context Optimization**: This is the deep technical section of the morning. Henry Bui discusses advanced strategies for **orchestrating multi-agent systems** and **context optimization** in Amazon Bedrock, ensuring high accuracy in complex interactions

#### 4. Hands-on Practice

- **CloudThinker Hack**: Facilitated by Kha Van, this 60-minute hands-on session allows participants to try out the CloudThinker services with free trial credit, showing the power of
CloudThinker in Cloud environment and how it could be leveraged to simplify the management of hundreds of different services available on AWS

### Key Takeaways

#### Evolution of AI

- **From Chat to Action**: The technology field is witnessing a strong shift from chatbots that only respond passively to **proactive Agents** capable of performing complex orchestration and calling APIs to complete tasks
- **Context is Key**: As workflows become increasingly complex, standard context windows are insufficient. Applying **"Context Optimization"** strategies is essential for reducing operational costs while increasing Agent accuracy

#### Architecture

- **Orchestration Model**: Managing a system with multiple Agents requires a strong **Orchestration Layer** to allocate and decide which Agent handles which part of user requests

---

### Application to Work

- **Prototype Agent**: Use **AWS Bedrock Agent** to build simple internal tools capable of connecting to existing company APIs (for example: checking server status or leave statistics)
- **Research Context Models**: Deep dive into context optimization techniques shared by Henry Bùi to apply to current **RAG** systems for improved performance
- **Join Hackathons**: Encourage technical team to participate in similar real hackathons for the fastest and most intuitive updates on AWS new features

### Event Experience

The event delved deep into the landscape of AI agent and its role in the business landscape.

- **Technical Depth**: The **L300 session** on Orchestration was particularly valuable, helping me understand how to scale AI applications beyond simple demos
- **Interactivity**: The **"CloudThinker Hack"** section helped me immediately reinforce theoretical knowledge with practice, making this one of the most effective learning sessions

# **Workshop: Data Science on AWS**

**Location**: FPT University HCM Campus

**Date**: Thursday, October 16, 2025

### Event Objectives

- Explore the entire journey of building a modern Data Science system, from theory to practice
- Master the **end-to-end Data Science workflow** on AWS, including storage, processing, and model deployment
- Gain practical experience with real datasets (IMDb) and applied models (Sentiment Analysis)
- Analyze trade-offs between **Cloud and On-premise** infrastructure in terms of cost and performance

### Key Content Highlights

#### 1. Role of Cloud in Data Science and Workflow Overview

- **Importance of Cloud**: Introduction how cloud services like AWS could help developer simplify their data processing pipeline and at the same time
help them save cost
- **Data Science Workflow on AWS**:
  - **Storage**: Use **Amazon S3** as the core data lake platform
  - **ETL/Processing**: Use **AWS Glue** for serverless data integration tasks
  - **Modeling**: Leverage **Amazon SageMaker** as the central hub for building, training, and deploying models
  - Overview of AWS's extensive AI/ML ecosystem, including AI services, ML services, and infrastructure

#### 2. Practical Demonstrations

- **Demo 1: Data Processing with AWS Glue**:
  - **Scenario**: Process and clean raw data from the IMDb dataset
  - **Technique**: Demonstrate effective feature engineering and data preparation methods. The workshop highlights different approaches, from low-code options like **SageMaker Canvas** to code-first methods using Numpy/Pandas
- **Demo 2: Sentiment Analysis with SageMaker**:
  - **Scenario**: Train and deploy a machine learning model for sentiment analysis from text data
  - **Process**: Illustrate the "Train, Tune, Deploy" cycle in **SageMaker Studio**. The session also covers the "Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)" concept, showcasing flexibility with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch

#### 3. Strategic Discussion

- **Cloud versus On-Premise**: In-depth discussion on cost optimization and performance metrics. Content highlights how cloud elasticity enables testing heavy workloads without large upfront hardware investment for on-premise infrastructure
- **Small Project Guide**: Introduction to a project designed after the workshop to reinforce learned skills

### What I Learned

#### Technical Workflow

- **Unified Workflow**: With wide range of AI services provided by cloud platform, the process of building AI application is as simple as ever, reduce the complexity of abstract theory
- **Tool Selection**: Learn to choose the right tools suitable for different scenario (Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Textract) and the pricing of each service to manage a balance project
#### Industry Application


---

### Application to Work

- **Apply AWS Glue**: Propose converting local ETL scripts to AWS Glue for serverless data processing automation on larger datasets
- **Deploy SageMaker**: Migrate experimental models from local Jupyter notebooks to **SageMaker Studio** to standardize training and deployment workflows
- **Implement Project**: Execute the small project proposed after the workshop to solidify understanding of IMDb data processing workflow

### Event Experience

The workshop **"Data Science on AWS"** show how Cloud platform has bring the process of building AI application closer to both business and users.

- With the rise of AI, businesses have to adapt quickly to the trend. However, the task of carrying AI application are both compplicated and requires high compute power
, with services from Cloud provider like AWS, the process of building AI application has never been easier.
- Services like Textract, Transcribe, Bedrock,... have made it easier for business or even personal user to build their own AI application with reduced cost and more
importantly, reduced complexity

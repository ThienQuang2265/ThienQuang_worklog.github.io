**Week Duration: October 6 - October 12, 2025**

### Week 5 Objectives:

- Test ML models to determine which architecture best fits the dataset (XGBoost vs Neural Network)  
- Understand why XGBoost consistently excels for tabular data  
- Learn NoSQL and DynamoDB fundamentals and how they support scalable applications  
- Build a baseline XGBoost model for the final project

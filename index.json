The streaming platform offers more than 200 classes, delivered by the world’s best instructors. With video at the core of the MasterClass experience, the company looked to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Media Services to help support its continued growth.\nThe company now uses AWS Elemental MediaConvert and Amazon CloudFront to support video transcoding and delivery, with AWS Partner Nomad Media as an orchestration layer. After migrating to AWS, including the transfer of its archive content, MasterClass saw significant video infrastructure improvements, including enhanced video quality; it also reduced video costs by more than half.\n“AWS provides a flexible solution that we can build on, so that we can create our own technology and IP around our media space,” said Paul Phipps, Senior Staff Software Engineer at MasterClass. “With MediaConvert and CloudFront specifically, we’ve dramatically reduced costs while improving streaming quality. We’ve also seen a reduction in buffering times and faster streaming across a variety of devices.”\nImproved transcoding efficiency with AWS Elemental MediaConvert When MasterClass launched in 2015, the company used a turnkey video solution to develop the platform. While that setup served them well for many years, the company’s needs grew as its content library expanded. Making more video classes available to subscribers required a more flexible and scalable solution, which it found in the file-based transcoding service AWS Elemental MediaConvert.\nToday, MasterClass relies heavily on the Quality-Defined Variable Bitrate (QVBR) feature in MediaConvert. QVBR automatically allocates bits to maintain consistent video quality, confirming viewers enjoy an optimized experience, whether watching on a smart TV, computer, or mobile device. Previously, MasterClass had to first process files with FFmpeg, resulting in two compression steps. With its new setup, MasterClass sends native files directly into MediaConvert, leading to noticeably improved video quality, reduced artifacts, and faster content delivery for users.\nSeamless migration and enhanced content delivery Along with providing the orchestration layer, Nomad Media proved essential to a smooth transition, providing tools that enabled MasterClass to parallelize workflows with minimal disruption.\n“We re-transcoded all of our content onto the cloud, so we could improve the quality of our legacy content with QVBR,” explained Phipps. “One of the great things about AWS is that every service is supported by a large infrastructure and serverless applications. Backed by that support, we were able to transcode most of our library in just a couple of days.”\nNomad’s direct integration with the content delivery network (CDN) Amazon CloudFront also influenced MasterClass while mapping out its migration. After evaluating several third-party CDNs, MasterClass determined that Amazon CloudFront provided the best fit.\n“We found that Amazon CloudFront performed better or as well as the other CDNs we assessed, and it was much easier to implement in our workflow since we were already using AWS,” noted Phipps. “Also, there isn’t an associated storage consumption cost, which is a huge benefit.”\nMasterClass was interested in a system that allowed for a high rate of cache reuse. Using CloudFront with Lambda@Edge, the company optimized its token authentication process. With this setup, its team can refresh tokens without changing the content path, enabling secure access and maintaining cache stability.\nLooking ahead with AWS With full autonomy over its media stack, MasterClass can now customize its video workflows and explore new feature implementations like content analysis powered by artificial intelligence (AI) or live streaming with real-time interactivity. As MasterClass continues to innovate and expand, AWS provides them with robust and flexible infrastructure that supports both their present needs and future ambitions.\n“Having control over our own tech stack is essential for scaling our offerings and continuing to innovate,” concluded Phipps. “AWS gives us the flexibility we need to build a future-proof solution that supports our continued growth.”\n"},{"uri":"https://thienquang2265.github.io/ThienQuang_worklog.github.io/1-worklog/1.1-week1/","title":"Week 1 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week Duration: September 8 - September 14, 2025\nWeek 1 Objectives: Connect and get acquainted with AWS Study Group members.

While AWS Config provides managed rules, many organizations need custom rules and automated remediation capabilities that can scale across their AWS Organization. This blog post demonstrates how to use AWS Config custom conformance pack to deploy and manage custom rules with remediation actions across organization-wide while maintaining centralized control.\nSolution Overview This solution implements a centralized compliance framework using:\nAWS Config custom rules with automated remediation Conformance packs for organization-wide deployment AWS Lambda functions for evaluation AWS Systems Manager for remediation The AWS Config custom rule configured in member accounts, invokes the evaluation Lambda function residing in the AWS delegated administrator account. The evaluation Lambda function residing in delegated admin account assesses target resources (e.g. AWS EC2 Security Group) against predefined compliance criteria and updates the evaluation result as either “Compliant” or “Non-Compliant” in AWS Config member account. Upon detection of non-compliant resources in the member account, the AWS Config rule will automatically trigger a remediation workflow through AWS Systems Manager Automation document. The AWS Systems Manager Automation document will trigger a Lambda function which is maintained in the delegated admin account, executes the defined actions to bring resources into compliant.\nKey Components There are two key components, delegated admin and member accounts\nDelegated admin account stores and manages: Lambda functions for rule evaluation and remediation AWS Config custom rule logic Systems Manager Automation runbooks Member Accounts: AWS Config enabled Cross-account access for centralized management In this blog post, we will demonstrate the solution by implementing a compliance control that checks for AWS EC2 Security group inbound rules. The rule identifies and remediates security groups allowing access from CIDR blocks larger than /16 (e.g., 10.0.0.0/10 or 10.0.0.0/1).\nImplementation Guide Prerequisites Verify access in AWS delegated admin and member accounts. Enable AWS Config in delegated admin and member accounts either through AWS CLI or AWS Management console Make a note of AWS Delegated admin account ID. Step 1: Deploy resources in the delegated admin account Download the CloudFormation template from this link. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudFormation service. Choose Create stack \u0026gt; With new resources (standard). Under Specify template, choose Upload a template file. Select the downloaded template and choose Next. The CloudFormation stack creates several interconnected components that work together to enable our compliance solution:\nFirst, it deploys two essential Lambda functions:\nConformancePackSecurityGroup function serves as our compliance evaluator, examining security group rules against our defined requirements. AutomationSecurityGroupConformance function handles remediation, automatically fixing any non-compliant resource configurations. To support these functions, the stack creates three IAM roles with specific permissions:\nConformancePackSecurityGroupLambdaRole enables security group evaluation AutomationSecurityGroupConformanceLambdaRole permits security group modifications SSMDocumentRole facilitates Systems Manager automation execution Finally, it creates the SecurityGroupAutomation SSMDocument in Systems Manager, which defines our automated remediation workflows.\nStep 2: Deploy cross-account IAM roles using CloudFormation StackSets Download the CloudFormation StackSet template from this link. Follow the steps in the documentation to create StackSets. Enter AWS Delegated Admin Account ID in parameters. Deploy StackSet across AWS Organizational Units. Step 3: Configure Lambda Permissions aws lambda add-permission \\ --function-name \u0026#34;ConformancePackSecurityGroupFunction\u0026#34; \\ --statement-id \u0026#34;AllowConfigCrossAccount\u0026#34; \\ --action \u0026#34;lambda:InvokeFunction\u0026#34; \\ --principal \u0026#34;config.amazonaws.com\u0026#34; \\ --source-account ${MEMBER_ACCOUNT_ID} Step 4: Share AWS Systems Manager Automation Runbook aws ssm modify-document-permission \\ --name \u0026#34;SecurityGroupAutomationSSMDocument\u0026#34; \\ --permission-type Share \\ --account-ids-to-add \u0026#34;111111111111\u0026#34; \u0026#34;222222222222\u0026#34; \u0026#34;333333333333\u0026#34; Step 5: Deploy the Conformance Pack aws configservice put-organization-conformance-pack \\ --organization-conformance-pack-name \u0026#34;SecurityGroupConformancePack\u0026#34; \\ --template-body file://SecurityGroupConformancePack.yaml \\ --delivery-s3-bucket YOUR-S3-BUCKET-NAME \\ --conformance-pack-input-parameters \\ ParameterName=ManagementAccountId,ParameterValue=YOUR-Management-ACCOUNT-ID Testing the Solution To verify that the AWS Config Conformance Pack will detect and remediate the security group rule, let’s test it by creating a non-compliant security group and evaluating the automated remediation process.\nFirst, create a test security group in a member account:\nNavigate to the EC2 console and create a new security group Add an inbound rule allowing SSH (port 22) from 10.0.0.0/8 Tag the security group appropriately for identification Within few minutes of creation, AWS Config will evaluate this security group.\nIn the member account:\nCheck the AWS Config console Evaluate the security group status change from “Compliant” to “Non-compliant” In the delegated admin account:\nReview CloudWatch Logs for both Lambda functions Confirm the evaluation detected the non-compliant CIDR Verify the remediation action completed successfully The solution should automatically detect and remove the CIDR range (10.0.0.0/8), maintaining only compliant rules (those with /16 or smaller CIDR blocks).\nCleanup Delete the conformance pack Delete the CloudFormation Stack Empty and delete the S3 bucket used for the conformance pack delivery Conclusion In this blog post, we demonstrated a solution for implementing organization-wide compliance using AWS Config conformance packs. By combining AWS Config, Lambda, Systems Manager, and AWS Organizations, we created a scalable framework that automatically detects and remediates security group misconfigurations across multiple AWS accounts. The solution showcases how to centrally manage custom compliance rules while maintaining automated remediation workflows.\n"},{"uri":"https://thienquang2265.github.io/ThienQuang_worklog.github.io/4-eventparticipated/4.1-event1/","title":"Event: Vietnam Cloud Day 2025","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition for Builders - GenAI and Data Track Location: AWS Event Hall, L26 Bitexco Tower, HCMC\nDate: Thursday, September 18, 2025\nLearning Report: \u0026ldquo;Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: GenAI and Data Track\u0026rdquo; Event Goals Present an overview of Agentic AI and AWS’s perspective on AI trends Learn how to create a Unified Data Foundation to enable AI initiatives and analytics on AWS Examine the GenAI deployment roadmap, AI Agent Architecture, and challenges in production adoption Explore the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) model Understand key practices for Security, Risk Management, and Responsible AI in Generative AI Introduce new AWS services designed to enhance AI Agents and business efficiency Speaker Roster Jun Kai Loke - AI/ML Solution Architecture Expert, AWS Kien Nguyen - Solution Architect, AWS Tamelly Lim - Storage Solution Architecture Expert, AWS Binh Tran - Senior Solution Architect, AWS Taiki Dang - Solution Architect, AWS Christal Poon - Solution Architecture Expert, AWS Key Takeaways from Presentations Agentic AI Overview – Jun Kai Loke Agentic AI focuses on building autonomous systems that minimize human involvement and automate complex workflows Successful real-world examples: Techcombank, ELSA Speak Amazon Bedrock as the primary AI platform, offering: Secure and scalable deployment Tool and memory integration Full end-to-end monitoring Creating a Unified Data Foundation – Kien Nguyen Current Issues: Many organizations are unprepared for GenAI deployment; only 52% of CDOs rate their platforms as ready (HBR) Main obstacles: data silos, personnel silos, disconnected business units Comprehensive Data Strategy: Combines Producers, Foundations, and Consumers Key AWS Data Services: Amazon Bedrock (GenAI platform) Databases (RDS and specialized vector-search support) Analytics \u0026amp; ML (SageMaker, Unified Studio) Data \u0026amp; AI Governance Lake House Architecture (S3, Redshift, Iceberg API) Amazon DataZone (Data management and sharing) GenAI Roadmap \u0026amp; AI Agent Architecture – Jun Kai Loke \u0026amp; Tamelly Lim Blueprint for AI Agents: Model \u0026amp; application capabilities, plus tool frameworks Amazon Bedrock AgentCore helps tackle production challenges AgentCore Components: Runtime, Gateway, Memory, Agent Browser, Code Interpreter; enhances security and scalability AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) – Binh Tran AI-DLC automates software development, comprising three stages: Inception: Define context, user stories, and plan work units Construction: Code, test, enhance architecture, deploy IaC, and validate Operation: Production deployment with IaC and incident management Security in Generative AI – Taiki Dang Core Security Elements: Compliance, governance, legal/privacy, controls, risk management, resilience Risk Assessment by Layer: End-user: hallucination, IP, legal issues Fine-tuning: data retention Model provider: training data, model construction Mitigation Techniques: Prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG, parameter adjustments, Bedrock Guardrails, secure prompts Standards to follow: AWS Well-Architected, MITRE ATLAS, OWASP Top 10 LLM Apps, NIST AI 600-1, ISO 42001, EU AI Act AI Agents for Business Productivity – Christal Poon AI Agent categories: Specialized, Fully-managed, DIY Productivity tools: Amazon QuickSight (analytics), Amazon Q (dashboards, reports, summaries, AI scenarios) Achievements Mindset \u0026amp; Strategy Agentic AI can automate routine processes, allowing focus on strategic work Robust data platforms are crucial to handle growing data volumes securely (e.g., S3) AI-DLC automates development from planning to deployment Architecture \u0026amp; Technology Understanding AI Agent architecture and AgentCore resolves production security and scalability issues Security integration is required at all levels of the AI stack, adhering to international regulations Technology Application AWS is expanding the AI Agents \u0026amp; Enterprise AI ecosystem with services like Amazon Q and QuickSuite (upcoming) Application to Work Process Optimization: Integrate AI Agents into repetitive tasks Quality Control: Leverage Bedrock, Amazon Q, Guardrails to ensure quality and prevent hallucinations Infrastructure Development: Build a unified data platform with clear governance for GenAI projects Implement AI-DLC: Apply AI-DLC methodology in internal development Business Insights: Use QuickSight and Amazon Q for dashboards and reports Event Experience The workshop offered practical guidance for transitioning from traditional automation to Agentic AI.

Functional Criteria:\nAuthentication with role-based access (Admin/HR, Manager, Employee) HR creates custom KPIs without technical support CSV upload triggers automated Lambda scoring Dashboard displays individual/team performance with charts AI chatbot answers natural language queries from DynamoDB data SES sends automated email notifications 2. Technical Criteria:\n99.9%+ uptime \u0026lt;300ms API latency (95th percentile) 95%+ scoring accuracy vs manual calculations 90%+ AI response relevance Zero critical security vulnerabilities 3. Performance \u0026amp; Cost:\n~$33.14/month AWS cost End-to-end workflow (upload → score → visualize) completes in \u0026lt;5 minutes 4. Business Impact:\nDemonstrates 60%+ HR time reduction potential Non-technical users operate KPI builder and chatbot independently 5. Delivery:\nWeek 8: MVP (authentication, KPI/formula management, scoring, basic dashboard) Week 12: Full features (chatbot, notifications, advanced dashboard) 1.3 Assumptions 1. Assumptions:\nThe current AWS cost estimate of approximately $33.14/month is accurate for the projected initial load and usage. The required data format and mapping logic for employee performance data can be clearly defined and provided by the HR team for the automated scoring engine. The Large Language Model provided by Amazon Bedrock to support HR. The automated scoring system is trained locally. The technical evaluation files of each team are assessed according to the companies\u0026rsquo; criteria and must follow the format provided by the customer. 2. Constraints:\nThe project delivery must adhere to the 12-week timeline utilizing the Agile Scrum framework. The solution must be built entirely on serverless AWS services to meet the objectives of scalability, cost efficiency, and reduced operational overhead. The final production AWS cost must remain around the ~$33.14/month target. 3. Risks:\nData Security/Compliance: Failure to fully understand or implement all of the customer\u0026rsquo;s specific regulatory control validation requirements could impact the project\u0026rsquo;s ability to meet security objectives. Feature Creep: Requests for features identified as \u0026ldquo;Out of Scope\u0026rdquo; could derail the 12-week MVP delivery timeline.

Why elasticity and scalability help prevent websites or applications from crashing during spikes in demand. Why cloud adoption is essential in a modern tech landscape where demand increases but not every organization can afford physical infrastructure. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Skills Gained practical experience building a functional AWS VPC:\nCreated public and private subnets. Learned how CIDR blocks define IP ranges in a VPC. Attached an Internet Gateway (IGW) to provide internet access to public subnets. Created a NAT Gateway to allow private subnets to securely access the internet.
